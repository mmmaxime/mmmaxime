## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Maxime and ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m on the continuing path to learn and and improve my coding skills. 
<br>
<br>
_Here is a little bit about me_...I'm a Product enthusiast for 1+ year with experience in the Influencer Marketing industry and Technology/Information sector. I'm motivated by managing multiple projects simultaneously whether it is in a team, or whilst working alone. In this ever-changing marketplace, I pride myself on adapting to situations quickly and all the while maintaining strong communication skills. I have found that nothing satisfies me more than meeting new people, developing new relationships, solving problems, and contributing to the growth of businesses
